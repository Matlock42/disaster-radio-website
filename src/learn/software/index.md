The software for disaster radio serves as an interface between the end-user and the LoRa radio. Currently, we have three end-user applications in development,

### Chat
A chat application served by disaster radio over WiFi for sending and receiving messages with neighboring nodes. Find the source code [here](https://github.com/sudomesh/disaster-radio/tree/master/web).

### Maps
A mapping application served by disaster radio over WiFi for dropping pins and sharing locations on a map of local area. Find the source code [here](https://github.com/sudomesh/disaster-radio-map).

### BLE Android App
An Android appliation that conencts to disaster radio over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and provides similar functions to Chat and Maps apps. Find the source code [here](https://github.com/beegee-tokyo/disaster-radio-android) and download the application from the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tk.giesecke.disaster_radio&hl=en_US). 

## Routing
The disaster.radio network uses the custom-designed LoRaLayer2 routing protocol. For more information on the details of this protocol, vist our [wiki](https://github.com/sudomesh/disaster-radio/wiki/Protocol) or read the source code [here](https://github.com/sudomesh/LoRaLayer2)
